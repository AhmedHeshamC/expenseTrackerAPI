## Expense Tracker API
Build an API for an expense tracker application.


Build an API for an expense tracker application. This API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete expenses. Users should be able to sign up and log in to the application. Each user should have their own set of expenses.

## Expense Tracker API

## Features
Here are the features that you should implement in your Expense Tracker API:

Sign up as a new user.
Generate and validate JWTs for handling authentication and user session.
List and filter your past expenses. You can add the following filters:
Past week
Past month
Last 3 months
Custom (to specify a start and end date of your choosing).
Add a new expense
Remove existing expenses
Update existing expenses

## Technology Stack
You can use any technology stack of your choice. Here are some suggestions:
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.
- **Database**: Mysql.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **ORM**: Sequelize (for Node.js) or any other ORM of your choice.

## Constraints
You can use any programming language and framework of your choice. You can use a database of your choice to store the data. You can use any ORM or database library to interact with the database.

Here are some constraints that you should follow:

Youâ€™ll be using JWT (JSON Web Token) to protect the endpoints and to identify the requester.
For the different expense categories, you can use the following list (feel free to decide how to implement this as part of your data model):
Groceries
Leisure
Electronics
Utilities
Clothing
Health
Others

AhmedHeshamC: analyze markdown file, give my the proposed design

Workspace: Collecting workspace informationBased on the requirements in R.md, here is a proposed design using the suggested technology stack:

**1. Project Structure:**

```
/config       # Database, JWT secret, etc.
/controllers  # Request handlers (authController.js, expenseController.js)
/middleware   # Authentication middleware (authMiddleware.js)
/models       # Sequelize models (User.js, Expense.js)
/routes       # API routes (authRoutes.js, expenseRoutes.js)
/services     # Business logic (e.g., filtering) (expenseService.js)
app.js        # Express app setup
server.js     # Server entry point
```

**2. Data Models ([Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)):**

*   **User Model (`/models/User.js`):**
    *   `id` (Primary Key, UUID/Integer)
    *   `username` (String, unique, required)
    *   `password` (String, hashed, required)
    *   `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (Timestamps)
    *   *Association:* HasMany Expenses

*   **Expense Model (`/models/Expense.js`):**
    *   `id` (Primary Key, UUID/Integer)
    *   `description` (String)
    *   `amount` (Decimal/Float, required)
    *   `category` (Enum: 'Groceries', 'Leisure', 'Electronics', 'Utilities', 'Clothing', 'Health', 'Others', required)
    *   `date` (Date, required)
    *   `userId` (Foreign Key referencing User.id)
    *   `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (Timestamps)
    *   *Association:* BelongsTo User

**3. API Endpoints (`/routes/`):**

*   **Authentication (`/routes/authRoutes.js`):**
    *   `POST /auth/signup`: Creates a new user (`authController.signup`).
    *   `POST /auth/login`: Authenticates a user, returns a JWT (`authController.login`).

*   **Expenses (`/routes/expenseRoutes.js`):** (Protected by JWT middleware)
    *   `POST /expenses`: Creates a new expense for the logged-in user (`expenseController.createExpense`).
    *   `GET /expenses`: Lists expenses for the logged-in user. Supports filtering via query parameters (e.g., `?filter=week`, `?filter=month`, `?filter=3months`, `?startDate=YYYY-MM-DD&endDate=YYYY-MM-DD`) (`expenseController.getExpenses`).
    *   `GET /expenses/:id`: Gets a specific expense by ID (`expenseController.getExpenseById`).
    *   `PUT /expenses/:id`: Updates a specific expense (`expenseController.updateExpense`).
    *   `DELETE /expenses/:id`: Deletes a specific expense (`expenseController.deleteExpense`).

**4. Authentication (`/middleware/authMiddleware.js`):**

*   A middleware function using `jsonwebtoken` to verify the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on protected routes.
*   If valid, it attaches the user's information (e.g., `userId`) to the request object (`req.user`).
*   If invalid or missing, it returns a `401 Unauthorized` error.

**5. Controllers (`/controllers/`):**

*   Handle request validation (e.g., using `express-validator`).
*   Call appropriate service functions for business logic.
*   Interact with Sequelize models for database operations (can be direct or via services).
*   Format and send responses.

**6. Services (`/services/expenseService.js`):**

*   Contains business logic, especially for complex operations like date filtering.
*   Example: A function `filterExpensesByDate(userId, filterParams)` that takes filter parameters and returns the corresponding Sequelize query options.

**7. Database:**

*   MySQL as specified. Sequelize will manage the connection and queries.

This design addresses the core requirements: user management, JWT authentication, CRUD for user-specific expenses, and date-based filtering, using the suggested Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and MySQL stack.
